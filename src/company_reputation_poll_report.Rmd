# Introduction

Many factors affect the reputation of companies. Axios and Harris have studied the reputations of the top 100 companies in the United States of America based on surveys that cover the opinions of more than 33,000 participants that have been conducted since 2002. In this report, the focus will be to explore companies' reputations over the last five years.

# Data

This data is the result of a partnership between Axios and Harris Poll to gauge the reputation of the most visible companies in America, based on 20 years of Harris Poll research.

## Methodology

The Axios Harris Poll 100 is based on a survey of 33,096 Americans in a nationally representative sample conducted from March 11 to April 3, 2022. The two-step process starts fresh each year by surveying the public's top-of-mind awareness of companies that either excel or falter in society. The poll only covers 100 companies that are classified as "most visible companies". The classification process is based on the count of the most repeated 100 companies in the representative sample's poll.

## Data Dictionary

The dataset contains two separate files, `poll.csv` and `reputation.csv`. The poll file contains information about the rank and RQ score from 2017 to 2022, while the reputation file contains the scores of the 7 attributes in 2022 only.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Poll EDA

### Data munging

Now, the summary of the poll data is represented below. Some parameters have NA values which means that the data requires cleaning before starting the analysis. However, these NA are not meaningless, as the NA in "change" conveys that the company did not change its ranking between at least two following years.

```{r}
summary(poll)
```

First, the data must be cleaned from replicates and NAs.

```{r}
poll %>%
  distinct() %>%
  na.omit() -> cpoll
```

Second, in the poll, there are two redundant columns for the rank and the RQ score of 2022. Hence, these columns will be removed and their contents will be merged with the rank and RQ columns, and cleaned again.

```{r}
# extracting the results of 2022
df22 <- poll %>%
  select(company, industry, change, `2022_rank`, `2022_rq`) %>%
  mutate(year = 2022, rank = `2022_rank`, rq = `2022_rq`)

# removing old cols
df22 <- subset(df22, select = -c(`2022_rank`, `2022_rq`))
poll <- subset(poll, select = -c(`2022_rank`, `2022_rq`))

# merging results of 2022 with the other years to reduce cols
finalpoll <- rbind(poll, df22)
```

Now, the data will be separated to its industrial categories to examine each category.

```{r}
# filtering the industries

changeInrank <- finalpoll %>% drop_na(rank)
changeInrank <- changeInrank %>% drop_na(change)

Groceries <- changeInrank %>%
  filter(industry == "Groceries")

Ecommerce <- changeInrank %>%
  filter(industry == "Ecommerce")

Other <- changeInrank %>%
  filter(industry == "Other")

Logistics <- changeInrank %>%
  filter(industry == "Logistics")

Automotive <- changeInrank %>%
  filter(industry == "Automotive")

Financial_Services <- changeInrank %>%
  filter(industry == "Financial Services")

Industrial <- changeInrank %>%
  filter(industry == "Industrial")

Food_Beverage <- changeInrank %>%
  filter(industry == "Food & Beverage")

Consumer_Goods <- changeInrank %>%
  filter(industry == "Consumer Goods")

Pharma <- changeInrank %>%
  filter(industry == "Pharma")

Energy <- changeInrank %>%
  filter(industry == "Energy")

Tech <- changeInrank %>%
  filter(industry == "Tech")
```

### Data visualization

The figure below shows the top ten companies in 2022, with their respective industries. It is evident that the top three companies are from the same, Retail, industry, in fact, the top two companies remained in their respective rank since 2017.

```{r}
#***** Findings: The top 3 companies all belongs to the retail industry
# Plot top 10 of 2022 using Lollipop Chart along with industry
# Remove duplicates from 2022 records
Clean_df22 <- df22 %>% distinct(company, .keep_all = TRUE)
company_rank <- Clean_df22 %>%
  filter(rank < 11) %>%
  mutate(company = fct_reorder(company, desc(rank)))

company_rank %>% ggplot(aes(x = company, y = rank, color = industry)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = rank), color = "white", size = 3) +
  geom_segment(aes(
    x = company,
    xend = company,
    y = 0,
    yend = rank
  )) +
  labs(
    title = "The Highest Ranked Companies",
    subtitle = "Rank"
  ) +
  theme_light() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
  )
```

It is apparent that retail companies have the best RQ scores, as illustrated in the following figure; preserving the top two since 2017. Meanwhile, food delivery appears to have lowest RQ scores, with best company in that category, DoorDash, having the 68^th^ rank.

```{r}
# best companies of each industry in 2022
bestcompany <- df22 %>%
  mutate(company = fct_reorder(company, desc(rank))) %>%
  group_by(industry) %>%
  slice(which.min(rank))

#***** Findings:best tech company is Samsung,  for eCommerce Amazon, for cars Toyota, for media we have Spotify
bestcompany %>% ggplot(aes(x = company, y = rank, color = industry)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = rank), color = "black", size = 3) +
  geom_segment(aes(
    x = company,
    xend = company,
    y = 0,
    yend = rank
  )) +
  labs(
    title = "The Highest Ranked Companies For Each Industry",
    subtitle = "Rank"
  ) +
  theme_light() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
  )
```

In the contrary to the previous figure, this figure shows the lowest ranking companies in their respective category.

```{r}
# worst companies of each industry in 2022
worstcompany <- df22 %>%
  mutate(company = fct_reorder(company, rank)) %>%
  group_by(industry) %>%
  slice(which.max(rank))

#***** Findings:worst tech company is Twitter,  for eCommerce Wish, for cars General motors, for media we have Fox corporation
worstcompany %>% ggplot(aes(x = company, y = rank, color = industry)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = rank), color = "black", size = 3) +
  geom_segment(aes(
    x = company,
    xend = company,
    y = 0,
    yend = rank
  )) +
  labs(
    title = "The Lowest Ranked Companies For Each Industry",
    subtitle = "Rank"
  ) +
  theme_light() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
  )
```

In 2022, most companies achieved "Very Good" reputation standing or above.

```{r}
#***** Findings: The mode of the Rank for all companies in the year 2022 is `Very Good`.
# meaning that most of companies in 2022 are rated as `Very Good`.
changeInrank$rq_cat <- cut(changeInrank$rq,
  breaks = c(0, 50, 55, 65, 70, 75, 80, Inf),
  labels = c("Critical", "Very Poor", "Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent"),
  right = FALSE
)

changeInrank %>%
  filter(year == 2022) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  ggplot(aes(rq_cat)) +
    geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
    labs(title = "RQ Category Distribution", x = "RQ Categories") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
    geom_text(
      position = "stack", stat = "count", aes(label = ..count..), vjust = -0.5
    )
```

Now, the following figures show some of the major trends for many companies in different categories.

```{r}
# Changes in ranks over the years for each industry
#***** Findings: most tech companies has low rank in 2020 while it raises in 2021
# TODO: extract some intresting scocials or comapanies
Tech %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, rq, color = company)) +
  geom_path(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "The RQ Score for Some Tech Companies", x = "Years") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Tech companies in general appears to have high RQ score, however this category is now having two new companies which are TikTok and Robinhood. Nonetheless, the year 2019 seems to be a critical year for most of the tech companies, specifically Facebook as its RQ score dropped by almost 20 units.

```{r}
#Findings: pharams companies has a low during 2020 during covid. However, in 2021 pfizer has a sharpe drop in rank

ggplot(Pharma, aes(year, rq, color = company)) +
  geom_path() +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "The RQ Score for Pharma Companies", x = "Years") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```

For pharma industry, Johnson & Johnson dominated the scene but its RQ score kept detortiorating until 2020 when a new competitor came to the poll and Johnson & Johnson RQ scores started to settle down.

```{r}
#***** Findings: Automotive companies in general after the year of 2019 has dropped in RQ scale
ggplot(Automotive, aes(year, rq, color = company)) +
  geom_path() +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "The RQ Score for Automotive Comapnies", x = "Years") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

In automotive industry, most companies' RQ scores has dropped after 2018 but came again to rise after the year of 2019.

```{r}
#***** Findings: groceries companies has rocked up after 2020
ggplot(Groceries, aes(year, rq, color = company)) +
  geom_path() +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "The RQ Score for Groceries Comapnies", x = "Years") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The groceries industry has been in decline since 2017, however, the industry seems to gain RQ scores back in 2022.

# Hypothesis Testing

```{r}
# Hypothesis
### Fitting Linear Model
lm.fit <- lm(poll$rank ~ poll$rq, data = poll)

summary(lm.fit)

### to get the confidence interval lower and upper bound
confint(lm.fit)

#***** Findings: the p value of rq is lower than 0.05. Thus, we can reject the null hypothesis
#< 2.2e-16 as the p value would indicate a significant result,
# meaning that the actual p value is even smaller than 2.2e-16
# (a typical threshold is 0.05, anything smaller counts as statistically significant)
# *****Findings:Multiple R-squared of  0.8497 means the it can explain 84% of variation in rank
```
